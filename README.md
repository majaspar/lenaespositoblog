<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This is a blog that I created to practise my web-developing skills.<br>
While at first it was only meant to be a project for my resume, it quickly became my system for keeping notes and my way of tracking my learning process.<br>
I regularly update the content - I post about my projects, new technologies that I learn and other things that I come across and wish to save for future use. <br>
Occasionally I also add new funtionalities.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Admin dashboard with options to:<bR>
Add, delete and edit existing posts,</li>
<li>Displaying posts with a pagination system in place,</li>
<li>Post grouped by categories,</li>
<li>Search functionality</li>
<li>Tags (to give more information about a post's content)</li>
<li>Comments section under every post</li>

</ul>
<h2>Access:</h2>
<p>While there is a user registration system in place, at the moment it's commented out. I plan to add more funtionality around users soon.</p>
